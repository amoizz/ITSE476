## Documentation

At **Librynium**, we understand the importance of clear and comprehensive documentation, especially for open-source projects. As weâ€™re still in the early stages of development, our documentation may not yet be as extensive as it will eventually be. However, it provides a solid foundation for understanding the purpose and features of the system, and we're committed to updating it as the project evolves.

Currently, **Librynium** enables users to efficiently manage library resources, borrow books, and keep track of due dates. While the documentation provides basic usage instructions, it will grow as we continue to add more features such as advanced search, fine management, and digital content support. As we progress, we will also include more detailed technical documentation for contributors, covering the code structure, best practices, and guidelines for making contributions.

Being new to open-source, we value feedback from the community, and our documentation will be continuously updated by moderators and contributors. We encourage developers to contribute to enhancing the documentation and help us improve it.
