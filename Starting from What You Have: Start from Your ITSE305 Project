Librynium is an open-source project designed to be continuously improved by the developer community. This project is an evolution of the ITSE305 project, 
where we laid the foundation for a basic data management system. Building on this experience, Librynium introduces more advanced functionalities like 
comprehensive book management, borrowing and returning systems, user accounts, and more.  We have a well-defined plan for implementing these features, 
and we are now focused on integrating them into a real-world environment.
The upcoming system enhancements will prioritize improving the search functionality, integrating digital books, optimizing user experience 
for both patrons and administrators, and incorporating reporting tools for library staff. The new system aims to go beyond traditional library systems, 
providing an efficient and modern tool that can adapt to a variety of libraries, from educational institutions to public libraries.
