Choosing the name "Librynium" for our project was a collaborative and thoughtful process. We combined the word "Library" with the suffix "-nium", which often represents essential or core elements, symbolizing 
that this system is fundamental to library management. After brainstorming several options, we conducted a poll within the team to decide on the best name, and Librynium emerged as the most popular choice due
to its uniqueness, clarity, and easy association with libraries. A quick search ensured that the name was not already in use, helping us establish a distinctive identity for the project.
