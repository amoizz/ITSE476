Choosing a meaningful and memorable name for **Librynium** was an essential part of the project. We wanted a name that clearly reflects the core purpose of the system—managing 
library resources—while also being unique and easy to remember. After considering various options, **Librynium** was chosen. The name combines **"Library"**
with the suffix **"-nium"**, which suggests a vital or core element, representing the project’s role as a key tool for library management.

The name selection process involved gathering input from the team and conducting a poll to ensure consensus. **Librynium** stood out as the most fitting choice,
as it not only captures the essence of a library system but also offers a fresh and distinctive identity. The uniqueness of the name was verified through research 
to ensure there were no other widely recognized systems with the same name.
