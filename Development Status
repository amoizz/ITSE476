## Development Status

**ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT ▶️** - The project is currently in the **beta** phase of development. The team is continuously creating, testing, and optimizing new features. Regular meetings and progress tracking ensure that we stay on track with the project timelines and objectives.

Using an iterative approach, we have successfully implemented the core features such as user registration, book catalog management, and borrowing system. As each function is completed, it is released into the repository for testing and feedback.

**Librynium** encourages collaboration and contributions from developers and the open-source community. We are always looking for new ideas and improvements to make the system better. Your feedback and contributions will be crucial for the full implementation of the system and its continued growth.
