## Starting from What You Have: Start from Your ITSE305 Project

The Online Library System is an evolution of the foundational concepts explored in the ITSE305 projec. It is designed to be an open-source project where developers from around the world can contribute, enhance, and adapt the system to meet the needs of diverse users. This project is an extension of the work done in the ITSE305 project, which laid the groundwork for building fundamental data management systems. With Online Library System, we are taking that foundation and advancing it into a fully functional library management system that can operate in a real-world environment.

The development process for Online Library System follows a structured plan, with a clear roadmap that focuses on addressing current challenges and improving existing features. As we progress, system enhancements will concentrate on optimizing the book catalog, streamlining the borrowing and returning process, improving user experience, and enhancing overall system security. The goal of Online Library System is to exceed user expectations by offering an intuitive, efficient, and scalable library management solution that caters to both physical and digital library needs.

## Choose a Good Name: write how you did that.


Choosing the name **"Librynium"** for our project was a collaborative and thoughtful process. We combined the word **"Library"** with the suffix **"-nium"**, which often represents essential or core elements, symbolizing that this system is fundamental to library management. After brainstorming several options, we conducted a poll within the team to decide on the best name, and **Librynium** emerged as the most popular choice due to its uniqueness, clarity, and easy association with libraries. A quick search ensured that the name was not already in use, helping us establish a distinctive identity for the project.
