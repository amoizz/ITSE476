# Librynium - Online Library System

**Librynium** is an open-source project designed to provide an efficient, intuitive, and scalable library management system for both physical and digital libraries. With a focus on user-friendly interfaces, seamless book management, and easy book borrowing, **Librynium** aims to meet the needs of libraries of all sizes.

## But First, Look Around: List All Projects and Their Links

Before embarking on the development of **Librynium**, it's essential to research similar existing projects to gain insights into best practices, features, and technology stacks used in the domain of library management systems. Despite the presence of related initiatives, **Librynium** stands apart due to its commitment to continuous improvement, and its approach to enhancing the user experience and system scalability. Below is a list of some similar projects in the field:

These projects will provide inspiration and benchmarks for developing **Librynium**, while we aim to offer unique features and enhanced usability.

## Starting from What You Have

**Librynium** is an open-source project designed to be continuously improved by the developer community. This project is an evolution of the **ITSE305** project, where we laid the foundation for a basic data management system. Building on this experience, **Librynium** introduces more advanced functionalities like comprehensive book management, borrowing and returning systems, user accounts, and more. We have a well-defined plan for implementing these features, and we are now focused on integrating them into a real-world environment.

The upcoming system enhancements will prioritize improving the search functionality, integrating digital books, optimizing user experience for both patrons and administrators, and incorporating reporting tools for library staff. The new system aims to go beyond traditional library systems, providing an efficient and modern tool that can adapt to a variety of libraries, from educational institutions to public libraries.

## Choose a Good Name: How We Did That

Choosing a meaningful and memorable name for **Librynium** was an essential part of the project. We wanted a name that clearly reflects the core purpose of the system‚Äîmanaging library resources‚Äîwhile also being unique and easy to remember. After considering various options, **Librynium** was chosen. The name combines **"Library"** with the suffix **"-nium"**, which suggests a vital or core element, representing the project‚Äôs role as a key tool for library management.

The name selection process involved gathering input from the team and conducting a poll to ensure consensus. **Librynium** stood out as the most fitting choice, as it not only captures the essence of a library system but also offers a fresh and distinctive identity. The uniqueness of the name was verified through research to ensure there were no other widely recognized systems with the same name.

## State That the Project is Free

üí•üî• **Librynium** is an open-source project released under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**, allowing developers to freely use, modify, and distribute the system. The project is designed to foster collaboration and continuous improvement, where developers can contribute new features, fix bugs, and refine the system to meet the needs of diverse libraries.

Several measures will be taken to clearly communicate the open-source nature of the project:
- The open-source status will be highlighted on the homepage and GitHub repository.
- A GitHub badge will be displayed to indicate the project's active development and open-source license.
- A **license badge** will be included on the project‚Äôs website to reassure users that the system is free and accessible for modification and redistribution.
